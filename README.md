Web-based APPs on Redpitaya <br>
Virtual Instruments on FPGA are controlled via a web interface <br>
LED, GENERATOR AND SIGNAL ACQ are the APPs <br>
Read thru reports/documentation <br>
Read extensively here -> https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developerGuide/devGuideTop.html#developers-guide <br>
Other Custom Instruments can also be implemented, since there is an FPGA.<br>


NOTE, if app does not work or does not connect, makesure that app folder name is same as value of APP.config.app_id in js/app.js <br>

BEWARE!!! the codes in folders carrying <with_comment> might have typographical errors, they are fully commented (not tested) version, although the tested versions (not heavily commented) are also available.
